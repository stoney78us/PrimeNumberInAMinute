I implemented 2 different methods to find max prime number in this program: 
	1. The first method is the obvious way to to find prime number. In 1 min, this method find max prime of 43911787
	2. The second method is to use Erostathenses Sieve to find prime number. Even though this method has O(n) space complexity it can find max prime of 1199999933.
After making the code more efficient, it can find max prime number of 1506051733. I tried further by ignoring even numbers to save space, the best record that my program
could find in 1 min so far is 2137439849.
